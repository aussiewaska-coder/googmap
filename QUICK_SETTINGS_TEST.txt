# QUICK SETTINGS TEST

Open dashboard and try this:

1. Pan Speed = 2000
   Save & Close
   → Should pan SUPER FAST

2. Pan Speed = 200
   Save & Close
   → Should pan SLOW

3. Rotate Speed = 300
   Save & Close
   → Bearing should spin FAST

4. Sensitivity = 0.5
   Save & Close
   → All motion should feel SLUGGISH

5. Sensitivity = 2.0
   Save & Close
   → All motion should feel SNAPPY

If these work → ALL FIXED! ✅
If not → Tell me which specific setting doesn't work
